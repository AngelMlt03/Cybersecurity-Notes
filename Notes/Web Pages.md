## GTFOBins
GTFOBins is a curated list of Unix binaries that can be used to bypass local security restrictions in misconfigured systems.
The project collects legitimate [functions](https://gtfobins.github.io/functions/) of Unix binaries that can be abused to break out restricted shells, escalate or maintain elevated privileges, transfer files, spawn bind and reverse shells, and facilitate the other post-exploitation tasks.
